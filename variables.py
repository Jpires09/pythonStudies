# Good practices:
# Snake case
# sugestible names
# const name in upper case


age = 33
name = 'jean'
print(f'My name is {name}. I am {age} years old.')

age, name = (34 , 'Jean')
print(f'My name is {name}. I am {age} years old.')


# There is no constant in python. The convention for such is to use the 
# constant name in upper case
